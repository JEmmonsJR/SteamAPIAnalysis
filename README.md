#Steam Analyst project for Nashville Software School DA10#

##Executive Summary##

I love games and I love gaming. That's why my project will revolve around the gaming platform, Steam. The goal for this project is to use the Steam API and a website called SteamSpy to gain insight into game popularity and trends within Steam. By extracting and analyzing the relevant data, this project aims to answer ‘What is a good game?’ The assumptions are that fps(first person shooters) and other fast-paced games that have short match style game play will be the most popular, but games with a story that lasts 15-20 hours will have a higher average rating. Major challenges are definitely around gathering and cleaning the data.
